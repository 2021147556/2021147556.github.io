I am a senior in the Computer Science department at Yonsei University, and I am interested in natural language processing and reinforcement learning, especially how hierarchical reinforcement learning can simplify complex tasks. I believe that natural language processing is the bridge between human and machine intelligence.

I look forward to exchanging ideas with more like-minded friends, making common progress, and promoting the progress and development of science and technology together.
